# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Machine Learning Project)

A **Machine Learning–based Movie Recommendation System** built with Python and Streamlit.
This project focuses on **similarity-based recommendations** and the **end-to-end journey** of taking an ML model from local experiments to a deployed, usable web application.

> The system is functional but intentionally not perfect — because the real learning came from iteration, debugging, and deployment challenges.

## 📌 Project Overview

This application recommends movies based on **content similarity**.
Users select a movie, and the system suggests **top 5 similar movies** along with their posters, fetched dynamically from the **TMDB API**.

The focus of this project is:

* Practical Machine Learning
* Clean data handling
* Performance-aware deployment
* Real-world engineering constraints

---

## 🧠 How the Recommendation System Works

1. **Movie Metadata Processing**
   Movie data is preprocessed and stored as a serialized file (`movies.pkl`).

2. **Similarity Matrix**
   A precomputed similarity matrix (`similarity.pkl`) is used to calculate how closely movies are related.

3. **Similarity-Based Recommendation**

   * The selected movie index is identified
   * Cosine similarity scores are used
   * Top 5 most similar movies are returned

4. **Poster Fetching**
   Movie posters are fetched in real time using the **TMDB API**.

## 🎯 Key Learnings from This Project

* How **similarity-based ML recommendation systems** work internally
* Cleaning and structuring **real-world movie datasets**
* Converting an ML model into a **usable web application**
* Managing **large ML files**, GitHub limits, and deployment constraints
* Understanding why **deployment often teaches more than model building**
* Realizing that **Machine Learning is not just about models — it’s about shipping usable systems**

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

* Cold-start problem for new users
* No user personalization
* Precomputed similarity matrix (no real-time training)
* Limited explainability of recommendations

These limitations are **intentional learning points** and will be addressed in future iterations.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Hybrid recommendation system (Content + Collaborative)
* Explainable recommendations ("Why this movie?")
* User preference profiling
* API-based recommendation service
* Improved UI/UX
* Dockerized deployment

---

## 🧪 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates **real-world ML engineering**, not just algorithms:

* Practical trade-offs
* Deployment constraints
* Iterative improvement mindset

> Still iterating. Still improving. Still learning.
